# Analysis-and-Design-project

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? 

The academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU needed a code where a student code finds the classes that they are taking.  This needed to be able to load a file from a data structure. Print an alphanumeric list of all the courses in the Computer Science department. 
Print the course title and the prerequisites for any individual course and exit the program. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. 

I approach this problem by going one step at a time.  Finding out how to get one of the tasks to work and working out any bugs and problems that came from it and then working on the next.  Understanding data structures helps create scalable, efficient, and maintainable code.  It directly impacts the performance and success of the software application. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? 

The way that I overcame roadblocks during the projects was by doing more research.  For everything that I didn't know or understand I would find more information online.  I also how got some books from the library to read in my free time to get a better understanding.  Another thing that I did was find videos on who to write the code. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 

With this project it has expanded my knowledge on different ways to code and solve problems that I may run into. I learned how to create interactive code based on given information from another file. And how to create working code that will sort and print out a list of the courses in alphanumeric order. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

With this project I learned that I need to write more comments for myself.  When creating more complicated code having everything, label saved me hours of time.  The longer the code became the easier it was for me to come back.  This could also be helpful for people that may also be working code with me.
